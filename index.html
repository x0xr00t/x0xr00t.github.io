        </li>

        <li><strong>PowerShell</strong><br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Common in Windows environments, used for scripting and automating system tasks, as well as exploiting Windows-based vulnerabilities.<br>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> Windows exploitation, automating tasks like lateral movement, post-exploitation scripts, and privilege escalation techniques.
        </li>

        <li><strong>PHP</strong><br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Often used in web application pentesting, especially for backend exploitation, injection attacks, and RFI (Remote File Inclusion) vulnerabilities.<br>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> Writing malicious scripts or creating backdoors on vulnerable web applications.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Go (Golang)</strong><br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Becoming popular in the security field due to its concurrency features and performance benefits for network tools and large-scale exploitation frameworks.<br>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> Developing fast, efficient pentesting tools or custom exploit frameworks.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Ruby</strong><br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Traditionally used with Metasploit, one of the most popular penetration testing frameworks.<br>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> Writing Metasploit modules, developing exploits, or extending the capabilities of existing tools.
        </li>

        <li><strong>SQL</strong><br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> SQL is used in database exploitation, especially for SQL injection attacks and database forensics.<br>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> Crafting and executing SQLi attacks, manipulating databases for exfiltration, or modifying data without authorization.
        </li>

        <li><strong>HTML/CSS</strong><br>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Necessary for web hacking, especially in conjunction with JavaScript for crafting payloads, understanding web applications, and creating phishing pages.<br>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> Exploiting front-end vulnerabilities, phishing, or defacing websites during attacks.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Tools & Frameworks</h2>

    <h2>Journey to the Top 50 on HackTheBox (HTB)</h2>
    <img src="images/top50htb.jpg" alt="Hacker Image" width="500">
    <p>The journey to reaching the <strong>Top 50</strong> on HackTheBox was an intense adventure for me, x0xr00t. It wasn't just about solving machines; it was about persistence, dedication, and growth in the face of challenges.</p>

    <p>When I started, breaking into the <strong>Top 100</strong> seemed like a distant dream. I found myself stuck around rank 200, constantly bumping into walls—figurative and literal exploits that just wouldn’t crack. The platform wasn’t forgiving. HackTheBox has more than a <strong>million registered hackers</strong> worldwide, and of those, around <strong>200,000 to 500,000 are actively competing</strong> on a regular basis. The competition is fierce. Every victory is hard-earned, and every defeat is a lesson to learn from.</p>

    <p>I pushed through, driven by the desire to prove myself among the best in the world. The closer I got to the <strong>Top 100</strong>, the more the stakes felt real. Every box cracked felt like a small victory, a step closer to that elusive goal. When I finally landed in the <strong>Top 100</strong>, it was an incredible achievement—but I wasn’t done yet. My sights were set higher: <strong>Top 50</strong>.</p>

    <p>It took time, effort, and sharpening my skills through every challenge I faced, but I finally made it. Being in the <strong>Top 50 hackers globally</strong> on HTB was validation that all the struggles, the late nights, and the constant pushing of boundaries had been worth it.</p>

    <p>HTB’s leaderboard isn't just numbers—it’s a reflection of the community of brilliant minds competing and collaborating on one of the hardest platforms. Reaching that rank feels like standing on a mountain peak, looking back at the path traveled.</p>
